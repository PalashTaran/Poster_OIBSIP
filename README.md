# Poster_OIBSIP
(Task 1)

I've used Canva software to build the assigned task.
Have made this on spiritual theme replicating religious values.
I'd presaved all my required graphics in a single folder (OIBSIP).
Have added a Golden Temple graphic, with a Guru Nanak's graphic at the background, depicting divine blessings.
Used different decorative graphics for a whole divine look.
Used an eye-catching font as a highlight, with curve shaped effect, aligning perfectly with the tag line and the whole spiritual tone.
Kept the whole layout in a golden color tone which sits accurate to the theme.
